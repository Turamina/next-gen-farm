## üé® UI/UX Improvements

### **Account Type Selection Enhanced:**

```

‚úì Full Name
‚úì Email Address  
‚úì Phone Number
‚úì Password
‚úì Farm Name (farmers only)

Optional: Address (can be added later from your profile)
```

  - Farmer: "Create your farmer account to start selling products"

### **Visual Indicators:**
- Green checkmarks for required fields in summary

## üîç Form Behavior

### **Customer Sign-Up Flow:**
1. Select "Customer" account type
2. See simplified requirements summary
3. Fill required fields: Name, Email, Phone, Password
4. Optionally add address
5. Farm Name field is hidden
6. Submit ‚Üí Redirect to home page

### **Farmer Sign-Up Flow:**
1. Select "Farmer" account type

3. Fill required fields: Name, Email, Phone, **Farm Name**, Password
4. Optionally add address

### **Validation Logic:**
- **Common validations** for both account types:

- **Farmer-specific validation**:
  - Farm name is required and validated
- **Customer-specific**:
  - No additional requirements beyond common fields

## üíæ Database Impact

### **Customer Profiles** (`users` collection):
```javascript
{
  uid: "customer-id",
  accountType: "customer", 
  firstName: "John",
  lastName: "Doe",
  email: "john@example.com",
  phoneNumber: "12345678901",
  farmName: "", // Optional, empty for most customers
  address: { ... }, // Optional, can be empty initially
  // ... other customer fields
}
```

### **Farmer Profiles** (`farmers` collection):
```javascript
{
  uid: "farmer-id",
  accountType: "farmer",
  firstName: "Jane", 
  lastName: "Smith",
  email: "jane@farm.com",
  phoneNumber: "12345678901", 
  farmName: "Green Valley Farm", // Required for farmers
  address: { ... }, // Optional, can be empty initially
  // ... farmer-specific fields (cattle, products, etc.)
}
```
