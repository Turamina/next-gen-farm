# 🔧 DIRECT CONSOLE TEST FOR PRODUCTS

## If `debugProducts()` doesn't work, copy and paste this into your browser console:

```javascript
// Direct Product Test - Copy and paste this entire block
(async function testProducts() {
  console.log('🔍 Testing products access...');
  
  try {
    // Test 1: Import and test ProductService
    const { productService } = await import('./services/productService');
    console.log('✅ ProductService imported successfully');
    
    const products = await productService.getAllProducts();
    console.log(`📦 Products found: ${products.length}`);
    
    if (products.length > 0) {
      console.log('✅ SUCCESS: Products are accessible!');
      console.log('Products:', products);
    } else {
      console.log('⚠️ No products found - check if admin has added products');
    }
    
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('❌ ERROR:', error.message);
    
    if (error.message.includes('permission') || error.message.includes('denied')) {
      console.log('🔒 FIRESTORE RULES ISSUE DETECTED!');
      console.log('📋 SOLUTION: Apply the rules from FIRESTORE_RULES_FIX.md');
    }
  }
})();
```

## Alternative Simple Test

If the above doesn't work, try this even simpler version:

```javascript
// Super Simple Test
fetch('/static/js/bundle.js')
  .then(() => console.log('App is running'))
  .catch(() => console.log('App loading issue'));

// Check if window.debugProducts exists
console.log('debugProducts function exists:', typeof window.debugProducts);
```

## Most Likely Issue

Based on your Firestore rules expiring on **June 25, 2025** and today being **May 26, 2025**, you're very close to the expiration date. Even though the rules haven't expired yet, you should apply the production rules immediately.

## Action Required

1. **Apply the Firestore rules from your FIRESTORE_RULES_FIX.md file NOW**
2. **Clear browser cache** (`Ctrl+F5`)
3. **Test products page**

The temporary rules will stop working in about a month, so it's critical to replace them with production rules.
