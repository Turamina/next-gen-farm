# Account Type Selection Implementation

## Overview
Successfully implemented dual account type selection for both **Customer** and **Farmer** accounts in the Next Gen Farm application. Users can now choose their account type during registration and sign-in, with data stored in separate databases and different user flows.

## üîß Changes Made

### 1. **New Farmer Service** (`src/services/farmerService.js`)
- Created dedicated service for farmer account management
- Handles farmer profile CRUD operations
- Includes farmer-specific features:
  - Cattle management
  - Product management for sale
  - Farm information tracking
  - Revenue and sales tracking

### 2. **Updated SignUp Page** (`src/pages/SignUp.js`)
- Added account type selection (Customer/Farmer) with radio buttons
- Visual account type selector with icons and descriptions
- Conditional farm name requirement for farmer accounts
- Separate database routing based on account type
- Different redirect paths after successful registration:
  - Farmers ‚Üí `/farmer/dashboard`
  - Customers ‚Üí `/` (home page)

### 3. **Updated SignIn Page** (`src/pages/SignIn.js`)
- Added account type selection matching SignUp flow
- Database lookup based on selected account type
- Appropriate redirects after successful login
- Error handling for incorrect account type selection

### 4. **Enhanced Authentication Context** (`src/contexts/AuthContext.js`)
- Added `userType` state ('customer', 'farmer', or null)
- Smart profile detection - checks both databases to determine user type
- Updated profile refresh logic for both account types
- Provides user type information throughout the app

### 5. **Improved Protected Routes** (`src/components/ProtectedRoute.js`)
- Added `requireFarmer` prop for farmer-only routes
- Automatic redirection for unauthorized access attempts
- Account type validation before route access

### 6. **Updated User Service** (`src/services/userService.js`)
- Added `accountType` field to customer profiles
- Maintains backward compatibility with existing users

### 7. **Enhanced Styling**
- Custom CSS for account type selection in both SignUp and SignIn
- Responsive design with hover effects
- Visual feedback for selected account type
- Icons and descriptions for better UX

### 8. **Created Auth Utilities** (`src/utils/authUtils.js`)
- Helper functions for account type management
- Centralized authentication logic
- Account type checking utilities

## üé® UI/UX Features

### Account Type Selection
- **Visual Design**: Card-based selection with icons
  - üõí Customer: "Buy fresh farm products"
  - üåæ Farmer: "Sell your farm products"
- **Interactive**: Hover effects and visual feedback
- **Responsive**: Mobile-friendly layout

### Form Validation
- **Conditional Requirements**: Farm name required for farmers
- **Type-specific Validation**: Different validation rules per account type
- **Error Handling**: Clear error messages for wrong account type

## üóÑÔ∏è Database Structure

### Customer Database (`users` collection)
```javascript
{
  uid: "user-id",
  email: "customer@example.com",
  accountType: "customer",
  firstName: "John",
  lastName: "Doe",
  // ... customer-specific fields
}
```

### Farmer Database (`farmers` collection)
```javascript
{
  uid: "farmer-id", 
  email: "farmer@example.com",
  accountType: "farmer",
  farmName: "Green Valley Farm",
  cattle: { /* cattle management data */ },
  products: [ /* products for sale */ ],
  // ... farmer-specific fields
}
```

## üîê Security & Access Control

### Route Protection
- **Farmer Routes**: `/farmer/*` - Requires farmer account
- **Customer Routes**: Regular routes accessible to customers
- **Automatic Redirection**: Wrong account type redirected appropriately

### Authentication Flow
1. User selects account type during registration/login
2. Account created in appropriate database collection
3. AuthContext detects user type automatically
4. Routes protected based on user type
5. Appropriate dashboard/home page displayed

## üöÄ How to Test

### Testing Customer Registration
1. Go to `/signup`
2. Select "Customer" account type
3. Fill out form (farm name optional)
4. Submit ‚Üí Redirects to home page

### Testing Farmer Registration

4. Submit ‚Üí Redirects to farmer dashboard

### Testing Sign In

2. Select correct account type
3. Enter credentials
4. Submit ‚Üí Redirects to appropriate page

### Testing Route Protection

- Farmer accessing `/farmer/dashboard` ‚Üí Access granted

## üìù Migration Notes

### Existing Users
- Existing customer accounts automatically work
- Legacy users without `accountType` field default to "customer"
- No data migration required for existing customers

### Future Enhancements
- Admin panel to view both customer and farmer accounts
- Account type switching (with admin approval)
- Farmer verification system
- Customer reviews of farmer products
