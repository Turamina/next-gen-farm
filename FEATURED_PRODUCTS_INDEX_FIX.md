# 🔍 FEATURED PRODUCTS INDEX FIX

## ⚠️ ISSUE IDENTIFIED
**Featured products not showing on home page due to missing Firestore index!**

## 🚀 SOLUTION: Create Firestore Index for Featured Products

### Option 1: Use Direct Link (Easiest)
If you see an error message in the console, click the link that appears:
```
https://console.firebase.google.com/v1/r/project/next-gen-farm/firestore/indexes/...
```

### Option 2: Manual Creation
1. **Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)**
2. **Select "Next Gen Farm" project**
3. **Click "Firestore Database" → "Indexes" tab**
4. **Click "Create Index"**
5. **Configure:**
   ```
   Collection ID: products
   
   Fields:
   ✅ isActive (Ascending)
   ✅ sales (Descending)
   
   Query scopes: Collection
   ```
6. **Click "Create"**

### ⏱️ Index Creation Time
- **Building time:** 2-5 minutes
- **Status:** You'll see "Building" → "Enabled"
- **When ready:** Featured products will appear properly sorted by sales!

## 🔧 TEMPORARY FIX APPLIED

I've modified the `getFeaturedProducts` method in `productService.js` to work without the index:
- ✅ Removed `orderBy` from Firestore query
- ✅ Added client-side filtering for products with sales data
- ✅ Added client-side sorting by sales
- ✅ Featured products should appear now

## 🧪 TEST NOW

1. **Refresh your Home page**
2. **Featured products should appear**
3. **After creating the Firestore index, you can revert to the more efficient server-side ordering**
